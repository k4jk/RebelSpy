Simple "no-frills" software for the Ten Tec 506 Rebel.

The main goal of this software will be to develop features for the Ten Tec 506 without adding any special hardware or other appurtenances. Hopefully this will be useful to operators who just want to have a few extra features that the stock Rebel lacks, such as a keyer with speed control and maybe frequency announce.

This will allow the Rebel to be used as a basic QRP rig without having to worry about hardware testing and debugging, or manually enabling/disabling features in the source.

I'd like for a novice user to be able to download the code and use it without having to modify it by changing any settings.
